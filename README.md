- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cy Howard. I work as an analyst for a fortune 500 company and do all the standard things that go with that. Mostly create ETL pipelines for visualizations and auto-mated e-mail reports and maintain a CRUD application made with React/Flask/MySQL(Re-factoring for Django currently) that is used to facilitate information across shifts for a maintenance department. The application is dockerized on a linux VM, performs automatic backups, logs API calls with information used in diagnostics, has a front-end admin panel for adding users and equipment to the database that then gets pulled in to the frontend form that the techs use to enter information about critical down-time events, and displays metrics from passdowns broken down by hour and production department.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... creating intricate social media platforms to help facilitate change in the world and building web based applications for small to medium sized businesses. I'm also really in to the idea of creating neural networks that explore how machinery can become curious and make assumptions about the world around it autonomously but that will come later in my career after I master the art of data analysis and move in to machine learning. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently utilizing ... JavaScript, Python, SQL, Django, React.js / React-Native, Tableau (VizQL), Pandas/Numpy in my day to day work.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... portfolio site is coming soon. Rebuilding and relocating to digital ocean.
